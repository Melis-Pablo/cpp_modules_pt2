# Class Relationships and Cross-Object Exception Handling

## Overview
This implementation demonstrates how to handle relationships between classes, manage cross-object validation, and implement proper exception propagation across class boundaries in C++.

## Core Concepts
- Forward Declarations
- Cross-Object Validation
- Exception Propagation
- Circular Dependencies
- Const Member Variables in Related Classes
- State Management Between Objects

## Concepts Explained

### Forward Declarations
- Declaration of a class without its full definition
- Used to break circular dependencies between classes
- Enables compilation when classes reference each other

**Example:**
```cpp
// In ClassA.hpp
class ClassB;  // Forward declaration
class ClassA {
    void doSomething(ClassB& b);
};
```

### Cross-Object Validation
- Validation involving multiple objects' states and attributes
- Clear responsibility assignment between classes
- Exception handling across object boundaries

**Key Points:**
- Decide which class is responsible for validation
- Keep validation logic close to relevant data
- Handle validation failures consistently
- Consider object state changes during validation

**Example:**
```cpp
class Validator {
    void validate(const OtherClass& other) const {
        if (!isValidFor(other)) {
            throw ValidationException();
        }
        other.updateState();  // Only if validation passes
    }
};
```

### Exception Propagation
- How exceptions travel up the call stack through multiple objects
- Proper exception catching and rethrowing
- Maintaining exception hierarchy across classes

**Key Points:**
- Clear exception hierarchy
- Consistent error messages
- Proper exception specification
- Exception safety guarantees

**Example:**
```cpp
try {
    objectA.interact(objectB);
} catch (const ValidationException& e) {
    // Handle validation failure
} catch (const StateException& e) {
    // Handle state issues
}
```

### State Management
- Tracking object state changes across interactions
- Ensuring state consistency between related objects
- Rolling back state changes on failure

**Key Points:**
- Clear state transitions
- Atomic operations
- Rollback mechanisms
- State verification

## Implementation Notes
- Forward declare classes to break circular dependencies
- Keep validation logic in the class closest to the data being validated
- Use const member functions for validation
- Ensure exception safety in cross-object operations
- Document state changes and requirements
- Consider using RAII for state management
- Implement clear error messages that indicate which object caused the error
