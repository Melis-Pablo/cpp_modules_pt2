# C++ Concepts: Abstract Classes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Abstract Classes
- **Pure Virtual Functions**: Methods declared with `= 0`
- **Base Class Design**: Creating interfaces with abstract classes
- **Contract Enforcement**: Ensuring derived classes implement required functionality
- **Virtual Destructors**: Proper cleanup in inheritance hierarchies

### 2. Inheritance Implementation
- **Derived Class Structure**: Proper inheritance syntax and implementation
- **Constructor Chaining**: How derived classes initialize base class
- **Member Access**: Understanding what is inherited and accessible
- **Method Overriding**: Implementing base class virtual functions

### 3. File Operations in C++
- **ofstream**: File output stream operations
- **File Creation**: Opening and writing to files
- **Stream States**: Checking and handling file operation status
- **Resource Management**: Proper file handling and cleanup

### 4. Random Number Generation (C++98)
- **Pseudo-Random Numbers**: Using rand() and srand()
- **Seed Management**: Proper seeding with time()
- **Range Generation**: Creating bounded random numbers
- **Randomization Patterns**: Understanding random number distribution

### 5. Protected Members
- **Protected Access**: Sharing functionality with derived classes
- **Implementation Inheritance**: Reusing base class functionality
- **Encapsulation Balance**: Deciding between private and protected
- **Interface Design**: Creating useful base class interfaces

### 6. Method Hiding vs Overriding
- **Virtual Functions**: Runtime polymorphism
- **Non-virtual Functions**: Static binding
- **Base Class Access**: Calling base class methods
- **Method Resolution**: Understanding how C++ chooses which method to call

### 7. Memory Management in Inheritance
- **Base Class Pointers**: Managing derived objects through base pointers
- **Virtual Destructor Necessity**: Preventing memory leaks
- **Object Slicing**: Understanding and preventing slicing issues
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup in inheritance hierarchies

### 8. Factory Pattern Concepts
- **Object Creation**: Dynamic object instantiation
- **Type Selection**: Runtime type determination
- **Pointer Management**: Handling object ownership
- **Error Handling**: Managing creation failures

## Best Practices Demonstrated
1. Proper use of virtual destructors in base classes
2. Consistent error handling across inheritance hierarchies
3. Thoughtful protected/private member selection
4. Safe file operation practices
5. Proper random number generation techniques
6. Clean inheritance implementation patterns
7. Safe dynamic object creation
8. Robust base class interface design
9. Effective use of polymorphism
10. Careful resource management in inheritance scenarios

These concepts expand on previous object-oriented programming patterns while introducing more advanced inheritance and polymorphism techniques.
